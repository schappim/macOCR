# macOCR

macOCR is a command line app that enables you to turn any text on your screen into text on your clipboard.
When you envoke the `ocr` command, a "screen capture" like cursor is shown. 
Any text within the bounds will be converted to text. 

You could invoke the app using the likes of [Alfred.app](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [LaunchBar](https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html), [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/), [Quicksilver](https://qsapp.com/), [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) etc.

Examples: 
- [Alfred.app Workflow](https://files.littlebird.com.au/OCR.alfredworkflow-aR9crGZYI92tYTa6Q5S1cRGr2rMc.zip)
- [Raycast Script](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/1405816e5ceb397cbc9028204f82dc98)
- [LaunchBar Aciton](https://github.com/jsmjsm/macOCR-LaunchBar-Action)

An example Alfred.app workflow is [available here](https://files.littlebird.com.au/OCR.alfredworkflow-aR9crGZYI92tYTa6Q5S1cRGr2rMc.zip).

If you're still wondering "how does this work ?", I always find the .gif is the best way to clarify things:

## Installation

Compile the code in this repo, or download a prebuilt binary ([Apple Silicon](https://files.littlebird.com.au/ocr.zip), [Intel](https://files.littlebird.com.au/ocr-EPiReQzFJ5Xw9wElWMqbiBayYLVp.zip)) and put it on your path.

Apple Silicon Install:

```
curl -O https://files.littlebird.com.au/ocr.zip
unzip ocr.zip
sudo cp ocr /usr/local/bin
```

Intel Install:

```
curl -O https://files.littlebird.com.au/ocr-EPiReQzFJ5Xw9wElWMqbiBayYLVp.zip
unzip ocr-EPiReQzFJ5Xw9wElWMqbiBayYLVp.zip
sudo cp ocr /usr/local/bin
```


When running the app the first time, you will likely be asked to allow the app access to your screen.

This should run on Catalina and above.
